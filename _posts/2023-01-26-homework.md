4.UI design

- In this section, I designed the work procedures or necessary functions based on user behavior. In particular, I designed the flow of screens and how specific screens interact with each other.

- Before designing the screens, I started with the planning step. In this part, I discussed about the topic, rules, and icon of the game with the team member.

**Topic**
The purpose of the game is to test users' ability to recall objects quickly. By discussing the game, we finalized our idea by getting a motif from Korea's traditional game: "When we go to the market" (in English: When we go to the market).

**Rules**
Figure 1 shows the initial idea of the game, including scenes, and rules.

**Designing scenes**
Based on these idea, I designed two specific senes:

    1. showing the list of the product that users should select : use the image of receipt, which contains icon of products and quantity that users should select
    2. the main scene of the game
    : on the left corner, there is the bar that represent time limit
    : on the right corner, there is pause button and setting button
    : on the middle of the screen, there is a shelf with diverse products
    : the colors of the object were designed based on the key colors of the game

**Designing icons**
Then, I designed the icon with the key colors:

    1. Used the bright color for background since it would be significant on the screen, which means it is better to attract users
    2. Since the game is about the market, I used the icon of the basket. In addition, when the user selects the correct answer, a coin sound will play, so I added a coin image to the icon.

**Designing rule book**
Our final step was to produce a rule book and tutorial to help new users understand the objective and enjoy the game.

- Rule book contains: summary, how to win, how to lose, how to change difficulty level, etc, and parameters.

    1. Summary
    : In this part, I provide general summary of the game, such as basic rules and objective of the game.
    2. How to win / How to lose
    : In this part, I provide information about how users can proceed to next level or failed to proceed.
    3. How to change difficulty
    : In this part, I discuss in detail how users proceed to the next round and how the difficulty level changes for each round.
    4. ETC
    : In this part, I talked about the final boss stage since we need something that can compare records between users as there cannot be infinite levels for users.
    5. Parameter
    : In this part, I mentioned the specific things that would be changed as the level increased.

- Tutorial explains the game step by step
 : explained the first and second screens
