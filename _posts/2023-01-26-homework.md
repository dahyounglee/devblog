4.UI design

- In this section, I designed the work procedures or necessary functions based on user behavior. Specifically, I designed the flow of screens and the interactivity of spcific screens.

- Before designing the screens, I started with the planning step. In this part, I discussed about the topic, rules, and icon of the game with the team member.

- The game is about testing how much users can memorize the objects on time. Through discussing about the game, we finanlized our game idea by getting motif from Korea's traditional game: "시장에 가면" (in English: When we go to the market)

- Figure 1 shows the initial idea of the game, including scenes, rules, and icon.

- Based on these idea, I designed two specific senes:

    1. showing the list of the product that users should select : use the image of receipt, which contains icon of products and quantity that users should select
    2. the main scene of the game
    : on the left corner, there is the bar that represent time limit
    : on the right corner, there is pause button and setting button
    : on the middle of the screen, there is a shelf with diverse products
    : the colors of the object were designed based on the key colors of the game
