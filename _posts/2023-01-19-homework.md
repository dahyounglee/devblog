## Understanding User eXperience, practicing and applying UI drawing

User eXperience is usually shorten down to 'UX', which is the essential knowledge to do UI planning from the UX perspective.

UI planning from the UX perspective has four steps: Requirement, Information structure model design, Wireframe, and UI Design.

1.Requirement

- researched the users needs and provide insights based on the game player's information

- game player's information:
: 56 years old housewife
: has failing memory
: usually enjoys going to cafe & shopping

2.Information structure model design

- content category and navigation design based on the information model design

- as shown in figure 1, practiced the work of information architecture by analyzing the Kakaotalk

- as shown in figure 3 and 4, for a new game, I brainstormed based on the information structure design
