## Introduction

---

The concept of reserve has been put forward to account for individual differences in
susceptibility to age-related brain changes and pathologic changes such as those that occur
in Alzheimer's disease. Reserve can act as a moderator between pathology and clinical
outcome, thus accounting for this discontinuity. One convenient, although somewhat
artificial, differential classification of reserve is brain reserve versus CR.

## Neuroimaging Studies of Cognitive Reserve

---
The epidemiologic studies suggest that at any given level of clinical AD severity an individual with a higher level of CR should have greater AD pathology. This idea is illustrated in figure 2. We tested this idea using resting regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) as a surrogate for AD pathology30, 31. In AD patients matched for clinical severity, we found an inverse relationship between resting rCBF and years of education.

## Application Of Cognitive Reserve In Clinical Practice

---

Integration of the most appropriate and valid measure of CR into the diagnostic formulation is critical. Individuals with high reserve, by definition, will not demonstrate disease-related clinical symptoms as early as individuals with low levels of reserve. This issue might partially be addressed with instrumentation, such that: 1) more challenging tests with higher ceilings may better detect changes in individuals with very high levels of functioning, 2) tests that are more pathologically-specific (e.g., associative learning tasks for the hippocampus) may have greater sensitivity in high reserve individuals.

## Conclusion

---

The concept of CR first emerged from epidemiologic observations. While epidemiologic studies can only describe correlations and do not directly test causation, they are useful for deriving hypotheses and exploring ideas. A wealth of epidemiologic studies suggest that an array of life exposures seem to be associated with a reserve against age or AD-related pathology.
