## Introduction

---

The concept of reserve has been put forward to account for individual differences in
susceptibility to age-related brain changes and pathologic changes such as those that occur
in Alzheimer's disease. Reserve can act as a moderator between pathology and clinical
outcome, thus accounting for this discontinuity. One convenient, although somewhat
artificial, differential classification of reserve is brain reserve versus CR.

## Neuroimaging Studies of Cognitive Reserve

---
The epidemiologic studies suggest that at any given level of clinical AD severity an individual with a higher level of CR should have greater AD pathology. This idea is illustrated in figure 2. We tested this idea using resting regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) as a surrogate for AD pathology30, 31. In AD patients matched for clinical severity, we found an inverse relationship between resting rCBF and years of education.
