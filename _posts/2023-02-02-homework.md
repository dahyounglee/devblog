## Finalizing the tutorial

The tutorial helps the user understand the steps and rules of the game. In this sense, it should be precise, simple, and well-organized.

To create an efficient tutorial for the upcoming game, I analyzed the tutorial for the Interplanetary Puzzle Contest, which is already being used by users. It contains steps and rules, which were explained clearly and concisely. It also used diverse colors that caught users' attention and made it easier to understand.

The next step was to brainstorm the tutorial based on the finalized rule book—containing a summary, ways to win and lose, how to change difficulty, and parameters.

The last step was designing the tutorial. Since the target user is Korean, the tutorial was written in Korean.

I divided the steps into four, which were based on screen changes in the game. The first chapter shows the receipt, showing the objects that the user should memorize both icon and quantity. The second and third chapters demonstrate how each button works: how to place objects in the basket and how to check the left time during the game. And the last chapter demonstrates how users can go to the next level.

Also, it contains what the user can gain after playing the game—including memory, hand-eye coordination, and item identification.

## Understanding the Develop step

In the Developing step, it is important to understand the user story. To attract a lot of users to play the game, we should focus on the User Story: As a user, I want a new memory game, so that I can enhance my memory. Based on this User Story, we planned the memory game. 

In this step, I learned Android development by using Android Studio. I learned the basic tools that I can use, such as the toolbar, navigation bar, editor window (place to write code), and the component tree (which shows the hierarchy of components in my layout).

For practice, I created a screen with a "Hi, I am Dahyoung Lee" text box and Like, Hate buttons.

I then created a screen that will be the first screen of the upcoming game. It contains the game's key image: grandmother + granddaughter + shelf.
