## Placing a color

There are 2 ways to control the cube: keyboard and the mouse.

1. Keyboard
You can use arrow keys on the keyboard to roll the cube on the square grid. By using the arrow keys, you can roll the cube in four directions: up, down, left, right.

2. Mouse
You can use the mouse to roll the cube on the square grid. By cliking the left part of the mouse, you can move the cube towards the mouse pointer.

## Things to know

When you roll the cube on to a blue square, the face of the cube picks up the blue part on it; when you roll the cube on to a gray square, the blue face on the cube will be dropped.
