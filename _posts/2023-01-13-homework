Figure 1. Example initial position

As shown in figure 1, the game starts with grid of 16 squares, with 6 blue squares and 1 cube of a square. The objective of this game is to get all 6 blue squares on 6 faces of the cube at the same time by moving as few as possible.

## Placing a color

There are 2 ways to control the cube: keyboard and the mouse.

1. Keyboard
You can use arrow keys on the keyboard to roll the cube on the square grid. By using the arrow keys, you can roll the cube in four directions: up, down, left, right.

2. Mouse
You can use the mouse to roll the cube on the square grid. By cliking the left part of the mouse, you can move the cube towards the mouse pointer.

## Things to know

When you roll the cube on to a blue square, the face of the cube picks up the blue part on it; when you roll the cube on to a gray square, the blue face on the cube will be dropped.

## Completion of the game

As you can see in the figure 2, if the cube picks up all the blue squares on each face, the games end. You can check the number of move on the left corner of the grid. dfdf
